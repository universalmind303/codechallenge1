# Code CHALLENGE

For testing purposes, I made a `generateInputFile` function that creates random input file sizes. 

You can run the test by inserting your input text to `input.txt`, or use the default provided, then from the console:

Python:

`python3 index.py` or: `python index.py`

Node: 

`node index.js` 

it will output to `output.txt`

In the console, it will display both the time it took to run the function, as well as the amount of memory used.
